This website is capable of getting an input from the user in the form of a city name and displaying the weather for that day and the 5 day forecast.

It will display the city name and date on the top of the page, followed by the temperature, wind speed, humidity and UV index.

It will also display the five day forecast with the average temperature and humidity.

It will show easy to see icons representing the type of weather expected that day.

Each city the user inputs will create a button to be clicked when the user would like to see the weather conditions for that city again.

All elements of the page are created dynamically except for the header and search bar.
